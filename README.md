```dart
    /// You Can use Any Widgets in flutter like this :
    /// Container(
     color: MaterialColors.blue;
   /// ),

   /// AppBar(
    backgroundColor: MaterialColors.green
   /// )

   /// But Note Very Important :
   /// you can use class MaterialColors just type proberity class Color
   /// Not use MaterialAllProberity ....
```

```
/// Example :
/// Scaffold Widget => Scaffold(
  backgroundColor: MaterialColors.red,
) ,

/// Card Widget => Card(
  color: MaterialColors.blue ,
),

/// The most important thing about the package is that it does not accept a class of type WidgetStateProperty because it has a different type; it only accepts the type Color. ///
